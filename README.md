# SpaceInvaders

A flash game I made for an interview in 2006.

## Features

•	Fully customizable maps and levels
•	Fully customizable enemies
•	Score
•	Player lives
•	Shooting enemies
•	Easily add new paths for enemies
•	Drag player with mouse or use keyboard (Spacebar is shoot)

## Suggested Improvements

### Refactoring

•	Enemy and Player class could both be derived from a parent because they have similar code.
•	Firing needs to be moved into Player and Enemy.
•	The parent of Player and Enemy could extend MovieClip.

### Other

•	Include items.
•	Bullets follow player.
•	End game.
•	GamePlay tweaking
